# It's time to start writing some real, working Python code. It'll be very simple for the time being.

# As we're going to show you some fundamental concepts and terms, these snippets of code won't be serious or complex.

# First we'll spend some time showing and explaining to you what you're actually seeing, and why it looks like this.

# As you can see, the first program consists of the following parts:

# - the word "print";
# - an opening parenthesis;
# - a opening quotation mark;
# - a string of text.
# - a closing quotation mark;
# - a comma, separating strings.
# - the separator / keyword argument "end".
# - a closing parenthesis.

# Each of the above plays a very important role in the code:
    
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World!")
