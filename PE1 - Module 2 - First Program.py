#As you can see, the first program consists of the following parts:
    
# - The word "print";
# - An opening parenthesis;
# - A opening quotation mark;
# - A string of text.
# - A closing quotation mark;
# - A comma, separating strings.
# - The separator / keyword argument "end".
# - A closing parenthesis.

# Each of the above plays a very important role in the code:
    
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World!")
