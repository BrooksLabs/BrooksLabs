print("What is today's date?") # print() function
date = input() # input() function
day = input("What day of the week is it? ") # This method merges the print() and input() into one line.
print("Today is", day, "~", date)

#   The input() function is a mirror reflection of the print() function; print() sends data to the console, input() gets data from it.
#   The input() function is able to read data entered by the user and to return the same data to the running program.
#   Virtually all programs read and process data. A program which doesn't get a user's input is a deaf program.
#   The program will prompt the user to input some data from the console (most likely using a keyboard, although it is also possible to input data using voice or image).

# NOTE:
#   The result must be assigned to a variable or else the entered data will be lost.
